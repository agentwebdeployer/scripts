# Exa Search Script

This script uses the Exa API to search for private colleges and universities in the United States with specific criteria.

## Setup

1.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Set up your API key:**
    The script will automatically create a `.env` file in this directory and populate it with a placeholder API key. You should replace this with your actual Exa API key.

## Usage

Run the script from the root directory:

```bash
python exa_script/exa_test.py
```

The search results will be saved to `exa_results.txt`.
